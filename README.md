QGIS plugin for reading STAC APIs 

Site https://stac-utils.github.io/qgis-stac-plugin

**The QGIS STAC API Browser currently lacks funding for maintenance,
bug fixes and new features; therefore development will be slow for now.
However weâ€™re dedicated to maintaining the project. 
For assistance or if you have funding to contribute 
please reach out to Kartoza ([info@kartoza.com](mailto:info@kartoza.com))**
